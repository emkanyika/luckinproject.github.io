<h3>Dear Luckin' User,</h3>
<p>Luckin' is an organisation that connects sponsees to sponsors worldwide to give them ability to achieve their dreams, whether in business(es), education, talent(s) or even treatment for sick sponsees by giving them a changing-life foundation.
    This also enables the sponsees to also give an impact to the society.
    In this way, the world would be a place of love, growth and equality. As Luckin' Organisation, we would love to see people being helped to achieve their dreams and also others to achieve their dreams by impacting other people's lives.
    Thank you for trusting in us.</p>
